EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

Priority: keep reactor temperature below TODO degrees.

This can be achieved by:

Venting the reactor. Possible only when Flux is low. Lowers temp somewhat.

Dunking the reactor core. Lowers reactor temp, but can only be done so much until the coolant is TODO(filled?). Despite the name, this is when the reactor core is *raised* into a suspended mass of coolant.

Lowering Flux - IF the automated systems are unable to automatically regulate Flux. Contact your superior. Flux automatically raises reactor temperature.

Thermal Dump. Full Dunk followed by Venting the surrounding air AND the coolant. Can only be done once. Last-resort, as this will cause severe-to-extreme dermal blistering.
